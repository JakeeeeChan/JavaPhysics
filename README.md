This repository is just a way for me to keep track of my progress in this. If you want to download it and mess with it youself, you can. Do as you want with these files. Commercial use or personal. It doesnt matter to me.

This project is made using IntelliJ Idea Commerical IDE so it will work best if you are using the same.

I am only 14 so there are many problems in the code. I am working on fixing them currently.
